## About this open-source project

If you're not a Terraformation employee, thanks for checking this repo out!

We're offering this project as Apache-licensed open source in the interest of sharing our technology with the world and being transparent about our work. Our mission is to accelerate global native forest restoration, and we believe we'll get there faster by sharing what we do.

For the moment, we're not asking for code contributions from the community. (Check our [careers page](https://www.terraformation.com/about/careers) if you're itching to work on this code!)

You may see references to some private repositories in the documentation. We're working toward opening more of our code, but not everything is ready yet.
