Some notes about language style:

- The words "Terraformation" and "Terraware" should not be translated and should be capitalized.
- The term "Accelerator" is a proper noun but should be translated.
- The tone of the translations should be formal but not stuffy. Address the user as if they're a
  customer or business associate, not as if they're a friend.
- The software is for management and funding of ecological restoration projects, specifically
  reforestation. If a piece of vocabulary is ambiguous in English and one of the possible meanings
  is related to this domain, assume that's the meaning the author intended.
