# Application profile for build-time API documentation (openapi.yaml) generation. Since dumping
# out the API docs only requires scanning the annotations and method declarations of various
# application classes, not actually running any application code, the idea here is to strip out
# all the initialization and minimize runtime dependencies so the build step is fast and reliable.
#
# Note that the base application.yaml is also used (this file overrides it). Many of the OpenAPI
# settings are there instead of here so that they also apply to the API docs endpoints when the
# server is running.
