-- We want deliveries to be associated with planting sites and optionally with plots. If they are
-- associated with both, the planting site has to be the right one for the plot.
--
-- Obviously we'll line everything up in the application code, but we want to guard against bugs
-- using database constraints too.
--
-- To make that work, we need to use compound foreign keys: keep track of the plot's planting site
-- and make sure the planting site of the plot is the same as the planting site of the planting zone
-- of the plot. Compound foreign keys require that the referenced list of columns have a unique
-- constraint.
