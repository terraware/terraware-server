/**
 * Returns the details for the user on whose behalf the current thread is doing work. For code
 * that's handling an API request, this is the [IndividualUser]/[FunderUser] for the human user or
 * [DeviceManagerUser] for the API client that made the request. For automated or background jobs,
 * it may also be the [SystemUser].
 *
 * Under the covers, this uses a thread-local variable. For incoming requests, that's fine, since we
 * process each request on its own thread. The variable is populated by [TerrawareUserFilter], which
 * runs before the controller method is executed.
 *
 * Code that runs outside the context of a request handler, such as in a unit test or a command-line
 * tool, needs to run as a user if it performs any operations that are protected by permission
 * checks. The easiest way to do that is to wrap the code in [TerrawareUser.run].
 *
 * This also applies to code that passes work to a thread pool, either explicitly or via Kotlin
 * coroutines. The pooled threads won't automatically inherit the original thread's thread-local
 * variables. If you're using suspending functions with a thread pool, make sure you understand
 * whether and when the code can resume on a different thread than its initial one.
 *
 * Design note: This is a top-level function rather than a method on [IndividualUser]/[FunderUser]
 * purely to keep the calling code less cluttered, because getting the current user is a very common
 * operation and it reads from global state anyway.
