/**
 * Generates user-facing identifiers. These are used in places where we need a unique value to
 * identify a resource but it's not acceptable to display the underlying integer ID from the
 * database, e.g., accession numbers.
 *
 * Identifiers are mostly-fixed-length numeric values of the form `YY-T-F-XXX` where:
 * - `YY` is the two-digit year
 * - `T` is a digit indicating the type of identifier; see [IdentifierType]
 * - `F` is a facility number that starts at 1 for each facility type in an organization
 * - `XXX` is a sequence number that starts at 1 and goes up by 1 for each identifier of a
 *   particular type in an organization, zero-padded so it is at least 3 digits
 *
 * The desired behavior is for the `XXX` part to represent the order in which entries were added to
 * the system, so ideally we want to avoid gaps or out-of-order values, though it's fine for that to
 * be best-effort.
 *
 * In the highly unlikely event this code still exists in the year 2122, the two-digit year from
 * 2022 will be reused, but this won't cause a collision; the next sequence value from 2022 will
 * still exist and will be used.
 *
 * The implementation uses a database table that holds the next value of `XXX` for each
 * (organization, year, type) combination. Facility number isn't included because we want the `XXX`
 * values to be unique across facilities of a given type.
 *
 * Note that although this class is guaranteed to only ever return a given value once for a given
 * organization ID, it is possible for the generated identifiers to collide with user-supplied
 * identifiers. To guard against that, [AccessionStore.create] will retry a few times if it gets an
 * identifier that's already in use.
