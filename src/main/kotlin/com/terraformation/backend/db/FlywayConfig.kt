   * fact, e.g., if they use SQL syntax that stops being supported in newer database versions.

   * In cases like that, we still need to run the migrations on empty databases as part of the build
   * process, so they need to be edited to be valid. But we don't want Flyway to flag the modified
   * migration scripts as validation errors in environments where the migrations were already
   * applied; it should continue to treat them as if they're already complete.
