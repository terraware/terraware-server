/**
 * Input stream whose total size is known in advance. This delegates all methods to an underlying
 * stream but exposes a property for the total size of the stream.
 *
 * This allows us to avoid extra round trips to external file storage services that already include
 * the file size as part of their "stream a file's contents" return values.
 *
 * [size] can differ from [available] since [available] returns the number of bytes that can be read
 * _without blocking_, and there might be additional content that requires blocking.
