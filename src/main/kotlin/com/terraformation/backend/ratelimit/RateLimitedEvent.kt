/**
 * Implemented by events that can be subject to rate limits. See [RateLimitedEventPublisher] for
 * details about how this is used.
 *
 * Rate-limited events are serialized to JSON and stored in the database, so shouldn't include any
 * non-serializable values.
 *
 * # Changing event classes
 *
 * If you make changes to a rate-limited event class, keep in mind that there may be existing
 * instances of the previous version of the class sitting in the database at the time your change is
 * deployed. You will need to do one of the following:
 * 1. Make sure your change is backward-compatible. For example, adding a new nullable property is
 *    fine since objects without the property will still be valid.
 * 2. Write a database migration to convert the old version to the new version. For example, if you
 *    are renaming an event class or moving it to a different package, but not changing its
 *    contents, you can write a migration to update the class names in the `rate_limited_events`
 *    table.
 * 3. Make a new event and keep the old one around for one release. Once any existing pending events
 *    have been published, you can remove the old event.
