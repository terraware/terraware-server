/**
 * Searches the database based on user-supplied search criteria. Since the user is allowed to
 * specify an arbitrary set of query criteria and ask for an arbitrary set of fields that may span
 * multiple tables, we dynamically construct SQL queries to return exactly what the user asked for.
 * This class is just the scaffolding; much of the SQL construction is done in [SearchField],
 * [SearchNode], and [SearchTable].
 *
 * The design goal is to construct a single SQL query that returns exactly the requested data, as
 * opposed to issuing a series of smaller queries and assembling their results in the application.
 * This maximizes the database's flexibility to optimize the query.

   * If there are more search results than the requested limit, the return value includes a cursor
   * that can be used to view the next set of results.
   *
   * The [rootPrefix] defines the starting table for field paths (all the paths in [fields] are
   * relative to the root prefix) and the top level of the search results. For example, if you have
   * an accession with two bags:
   * - Searching with a root prefix of `accessions` and a field name of `bags.number` will give you
   *   a result like `[{"bags":[{"number":"1"}, {"number":"2"}]}]`, that is, a single top-level
   *   result with a sublist that has two elements.
   * - Searching with a root prefix of `bags` and a field name of `number` will give you a result
   *   like `[{"number":"1"},{"number":"2"}]`, that is, two top-level results with no sublists.
   *
   * If the filter criteria include any fuzzy matches, the system will first try to find exact
   * matches for the search terms; if there are any, it will return those and not do a fuzzy search.
