/**
 * The location of a search field in the application's data hierarchy.
 *
 * The full path of a search field consists of a root, zero or more sublists, and a scalar field.
 * The root and the list of sublists live in [SearchFieldPrefix] and the scalar field lives here.
 *
 * A filesystem analogy to help clarify the different parts:
 *
 * ```
 * $ cd /a/b/c
 * $ cat d/e/file
 * ```
 *
 * The root is like your current working directory, `/a/b/c` in the filesystem analogy. All relative
 * paths are evaluated starting from there.
 *
 * The sublists are like a series of subdirectories in a relative path, `d/e` in the analogy. The
 * first one needs to exist in the root (working directory), the second needs to exist in the first,
 * and so on.
 *
 * The scalar field is like the filename of a regular file. In the analogy it is `file`.
 *
 * There can be multiple paths that refer to the same field. To continue with the filesystem
 * analogy, the following would output the same file as the first example:
 *
 * ```
 * $ cd /a/b/c/d/e
 * $ cat file
 * ```
 *
 * The difference is how the two are mapped to search results. In the first case, the search results
 * would be structured like `[{"d":[{"e":[{"file":"contents"}]}]}]` whereas in the second case, the
 * structure would be `[{"file":"contents"}]`. This is very significant to the client because it
 * controls how results are grouped together when there are multiple values for a particular field.
