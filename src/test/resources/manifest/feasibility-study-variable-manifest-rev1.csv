This project is planting {{Number of trees per hectare - 1113}} per hectare, where {{Number of native species - 1114}} are native to the region, and {{Number of non-native species - 1115}} are being planted for {{Reason to use non-native species - 1116}}. The full list of species can be found here in Appendix X. {{Organization Name - 1117}} {{Project has restoration plan - 1118}} a {{Restoration plan type - 1119}} in place which follows the {{Framework or methodology - 1120}} of {{Methodology name - 1121}} ({{Methodology source - 1122}}). They plan to plant {{Est planting hectares in Year 1 - 1123}} ha in year 1, {{Est planting hectares in Year 2 - 1124}} ha in year 2, and {{Est planting hectares in subsequent years - 1125}} ha in subsequent years until the ecosystem reaches a state of equilibrium in year {{Year where equilibrium state is reached - 1126}}. This same {{Framework or methodology - 1120}} is applied to the list of species chosen for restoration. 
The species list has been carefully selected and checked against publications in {{Species list references - 1127}}, ensuring that species to be planted are native and adapted to the ecological zone of the project.

They {{Do they prep land - 1128}} prepare the land prior to planting with {{Land prep steps - 1129}}. Invasive and problematic species that would need to be removed during land preparation include {{Invasive species to remove - 1130}}. "
